# GifTastic

Project Description:

This is an app to search for and view gifs from giohy api. It was created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS/Twitter Bootstrap. It has a college football theme for the gifs.

How does it work? 
There are predefined buttons with college teams already created and located at the top of the screen.  When the user clicks on a button, still gifs of the team will display on screen.  The user can also click the image to animate it and click it again to make it still.  The user can also enter a new team in the textbox on screen, click submit and a new team button will be generated and appear on screen.  They can then click the new button and gifs for that team will appear and can be animated on click.
